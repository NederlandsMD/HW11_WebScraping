# Mission to Mars: Web Scraping, Flask, MongoDB

This project uses Python Beautiful Soup to scrape the web for the latest information on--and images from--the mission to mars. It then stores this data in a Mongo database, and sends the content to HTML via Flask creating a dynamically updating website with the latest information on the mission.
